# to make the 'package' command work:
#  - run mvn package...
#  - and point to the right jar location
    CodeUri: ../path/to/code.jar

# package the code, sending the jars to an s3 bucket with a unique name
aws cloudformation package --template-file ${INFRA} --s3-bucket ${BUCKET} --output-template-file out.yaml
# "Before the command uploads artifacts, it checks if the artifacts are already present in the S3 bucket...
# The command uses MD5 checksums to compare files. If the values match, the command doesn't upload the artifacts. Use the --force-upload flag to skip this check..."
# if you look at the output (out.yaml), you can see that de CodeUri now points to S3
# if you change your code, *and* do a new mvn package, it will generate another upload with a new name/zip

# we can use the 'out' file to deploy
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file out.yaml --stack-name ${NAME} --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
